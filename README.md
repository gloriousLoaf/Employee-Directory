## Description
A basic ``` create-react-app ``` (CRA) project built to demonstrate the essentials of working with React modules. The directory table was built with [ ``` react-strap-table ``` ](https://github.com/AsemAlalami/react-strap-table) and the "employees" were pulled from [mockAPI](https://mockapi.io/).
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Installation
To create your own version of this app, clone this repository then go to the root directory and run ``` npm install ``` . Once the installation is complete, run ``` npm start ``` and visit **localhost://3000** to view it in a dev environment. Run ``` npm run build ``` to create a production build.

This app is deployed via Heroku using [Heroku Buildpack](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack). **To see it in action, go here** ðŸ‘‰ [React-Employee-Directory](https://react-employee-directory3.herokuapp.com/).
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Usage
The user is able to search through the directory by name or email via the *Search* input form. The user can also click the up & down arrow icons in each table header to sort ascending or descending. Additional entries beyond the first 10 "employees" are paginated, with navigation at the bottom of the table.
